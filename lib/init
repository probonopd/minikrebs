You can use the following images:

    System Upgrade: ${SYSUPGRADE:-No sysupgrade produced}

It seems like the factory image has not been created, it could mean
that the image would be too big and does not fit into the tiny FLASH.

Observe the output above, fix, and retry building.
In bin/ :
  $(find bin/)
